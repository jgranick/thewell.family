## Food Ministry

    <p>For 20 years Pastor Greg served in ministry feeding people both spiritually and physically. Due to construction injuries he could no longer work construction and was forced to medically retire. However he still uses his skills to help this church's ministries. In January 2017 the Lord asked Pastor Greg to pastor the church on 1431 North Machias Rd. With his family and a few supporters, services began at The Well Church. In 2019 we had the privilege to purchase the church building and property with the help of many. Pastor Greg has been called to be a father and to help raise up people to be mature and complete in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</p>

    <h3>Blessing Box</h3>
    <p>The Blessing Box began in the front of our house and many people walked as far as from Everett to come and get free food and supplies. Pastor Greg would pray for people and allow people a place to rest and sleep in the back of his work truck.</p>

    <h3>Support</h3>
    <p>In March 2020 as COVID-19 struck the state of Washington and this nation, amidst the great fear and panic, the Lord impressed upon Greg to rekindle the Blessing Box in a much larger fashion. Since then, Pastor Greg has given over 100 hours a week towards this ministry, helping give food to many other food banks, churches, missions, and ministries. The average at this time is 1 million pounds of food per month brought in for free. With this ministry comes a great expense, costing roughly $12,000 a month. These operational costs include a truck rental, fuel, electricity, insurance, etc. We would appreciate it if you would consider financially partnering with us as we are a small church with a big heart.</p>
    <p>Our food ministry and pastors Greg and Amy thank you.</p>
