      <p>In the book of Acts we see the Apostles establishing the Deacon ministry for the daily distribution of bread and handling the business side of ministry so the Apostles could focus on ministering the word of God.</p>
      <p>Our Deacon Ministry does a great deal for this community. From giving food weekly to the community, firewood, construction repairs and more, the Well Church cares about the people in its community. We would appreciate your financial support in this ministry</p>
