    <h3>Intercessory Prayer Ministry</h3>
    <p>Justin and Paula Short moved from California to Washington state, the Lord spoke to them and they listened and packed up everything on faith and drove north to our little church. We are so thankful that they listened, obeyed, and came to The Well Church and joined the team.</p>
    <p>Justin has an incredible gift of intercession and a master's degree in psychology. Paula carries a prophetic anointing that gives valuable discernment in signs and wonders. We are thankful for their friendship and what they bring to this ministry team.</p>
