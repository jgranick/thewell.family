    <h3>2nd Life Youth</h3>
    <p>Our youth are very important to us. On Tuesday nights we meet from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM at The Well Church for dinner, games, word, and worship. <!--We also meet every other Friday for fellowship nights at Greg and Amy's Home. We give the youth an alternative for Friday nights to press into God and make friends. <br><br>During the summer we have camp and other outdoor adventures together as a youth group. We will have campfires, go scootering down the Centennial Trail.--> We enjoy being together and glorifying our Lord.</p>
